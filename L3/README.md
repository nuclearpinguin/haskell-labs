RWH p.108:
> A fold takes more effort to understand than, say, a composition of map and filter 
> that does the same thing, but it behaves more regularly and predictably than a tail recursive function.
> As a general rule, donâ€™t use a fold if you can compose some library functions, 
> but otherwise try to use a fold in preference to a hand-rolled tail recursive loop.
