[How do you pronounce various operators?](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/b7pyqr/monthly_hask_anything_april_2019/ejzc8rn?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

```
(>=>) - fish
(>>=) - bind
(>>) - then
(:) - cons
(<$>) - fmap
(<*>) - ap, apply, or spaceship
(<>) or (++) - append
(<|>) - or (or maybe alt if I also use (||) somewhere
(.) - dot
```


### Tricks

In ghci `:set -XOverloadedStrings` if `{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}` does not work.
