# Functional Programming at WUT

Notes from lectures and codes from labs. This repo has the following structure:

```
- L1
    - README.md - lecture notes
    - someFile.hs - lab codes
- L2
...
```

```
(>=>) - fish
(>>=) - bind
(>>) - then
(:) - cons
(<$>) - fmap
(<*>) - ap, apply, or spaceship
(<>) or (++) - append
(<|>) - or (or maybe alt if I also use (||) somewhere
(.) - dot
```


### Tricks

In ghci `:set -XOverloadedStrings` if `{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}` does not work.
